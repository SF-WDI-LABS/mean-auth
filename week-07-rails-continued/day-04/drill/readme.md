> Hello Ben,
>
> It was nice speaking with you over the phone yesterday about our open "Jr. Ruby Developer" position. We'd like to move forward in our interviewing process by having you complete a technical interview with one of our engineers.
>
> The interview will involve a few general technical questions followed by a challenge.
>
> We are expecting you to complete the challenge using Ruby and our questions will be related to the Ruby programming language or fundamentals not related to the language's implementation.
>
> Please prepare in advance to be in a quiet location with adequate headphones which include a microphone.
>
> Verify that you can access our <a href="https://coderpad.io/W4KP4FKT" target="_blank">CoderPad link</a> as soon as possible.
>
> The interview will last 30-45 minutes with time at the end for questions.
>
> Does Thursday December 17th at 9:17am PST work OK for you?
