Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of numbers and returns a merged array of the sorted numbers. For example:

```js
var arr1 = [3, 6, 11];
var arr2 = [2, 4, 5, 8, 9];

merge(arr1, arr2);
//=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11]
```

**Before you start:** Write some tests! Create a series of simple tests that prove you're getting the correct output (and will make your life easier as a developer).
