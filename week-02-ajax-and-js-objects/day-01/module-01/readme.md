# Debugging JavaScript

 | Objectives |
 | :--- |
 | Inspect a variable's state using Chrome's JavaScript Debugger. |
 | Summarize why a debugger is useful while developing software. |
 | Analyze a debugger's watch list to find an out of scope variable. |


Explicit it is OK to not know it, ask for explanations of terms later.

# Why use a debugger?
* Did anyone experience frustration while not able to figure out why something is broken?
* How did you fix your program?
* Someone will come up to you and tell you something is broken, your product will be judged based on how quickly you respond to that issue.
  * Ask about experiences with something broken and if it felt well when it was fixed quickly.
* Ask about real world debugging (broken car, bad coffee)
# What is a debugger?
* Show a complex program
* Show a debugger
* Some quotes from industry
# Launching Chrome's JavaScript Debugger
* Launch from inspecting element
* Launch from keyword
# Set a break point in Chrome's JavaScript Debugger
* What is a break point.
* Why set a break point.
* Ask people to try setting a breakpoint.
* Use the `debugger` keyword to set a breakpoint.
# Inspect a variable's state while execution is paused
* Look at a variables value
* Inspect an object
* Update an object
# Continue execution of the program
* When to continue
# Stepping in and over code
* Investigate deeper
* Ingore misleading statements
# Using the watch list in Chrome's JavaScript Debugger
* Create for loop
* Show outer scope, and inner scope
# Conclusion
* Challenge to try using the debugger.
* Compare difficulty of debugging something more complex.
* Practice with this tool will help in the projects you create and your ability to do them quicker.
* Next time your program does something unexpected, try using the debugger.
