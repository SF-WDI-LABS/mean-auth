 | Summarize why a debugger is useful while developing software. |
 | Analyze a debugger's watch list to find an out of scope variable. |


 Explicit it is OK to not know it, ask for explanations of terms later.


# Why use a debugger?
* Did anyone experience frustration while not able to figure out why something is broken?
* How did you fix your program?
* Someone will come up to you and tell you something is broken, your product will be judged based on how quickly you respond to that issue.
  * Ask about experiences with something broken and if it felt well when it was fixed quickly.
* Ask about real world debugging (broken car, bad coffee)
# What is a debugger?
* Show a complex program
* Show a debugger
* Some quotes from industry

# Inspect a variable's state while execution is paused
# Continue execution of the program
# Stepping in and over code
# Using the watch list in Chrome's JavaScript Debugger
# Conclusion
* Challenge to try using the debugger.
* Compare difficulty of debugging something more complex.
* Practice with this tool will help in the projects you create and your ability to do them quicker.
* Next time your program does something unexpected, try using the debugger.
