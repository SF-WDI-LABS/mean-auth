## Any general issues from homework?

Let's go over any problems people had on their homework.

Did you get stuck? Did you get the expected results at the end? Which part was the most difficult?

## Pair up.

Now we have an opportunity collaborate with a colleague to get feedback on our solutions. In order for us to be successful, we will need to work as a team and collaborate on ideas.

### Why pair?

Because we're a team and having a second perspective can enlighten us on alternate routes which may save us time or improve our code.

### When pairing.

When you pair, it is customary to have one person at the keyboard while the other person watches and offers advice.

As the driver (person using the keyboard) you must trust your partner and listen to what they say.

The navigator (person not using the keyboard) you can't touch the keyboard and must use your words to help describe what you would like to try. This requires a great deal of patience so if you become stuck try closing the computer and using a white board to describe your ideas.
