## React Native

> React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about â€” learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native. [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

An important word which is often used in mobile application is "Native". Native app is used to describe an application which has been developed for a specific platform. A native Android app will be an application programmed to run on the Android operating system.

When we're making web applications, they're typically not tied to a platform. They work on any system which recognizes JavaScript, HTML and CSS. You can use the web on phones, Apple systems, Windows systems, Linux systems, cars, airplanes and the International Space Station.

Native applications have some particular drawbacks. Native applications must be built in a programming language specific to a platform. On iOS this is likely Objective-C or Swift while on Android it is typically Java. This means a native application developed for Android won't run on an iOS device. If you want a mobile application for your service you'll have to make two version of it.

Web applications can run on all these devices but have the drawback of being hella slow.

React Native is a bridge between the two, it offers natively compiled applications developed using JavaScript. This seems great except it introduces a great deal of complexity.

## Getting Started with React Native

Downloading the required utilities takes the majority of your free disk space and a solid afternoon. We won't be able to accomplish this in an afternoon so instead we'll look at some terms which are used in mobile development which are not common in web development.
