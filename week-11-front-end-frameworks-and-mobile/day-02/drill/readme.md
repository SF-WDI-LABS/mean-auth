### Basic Math Terminology
**These are terms you need to know but is by no means an exaustive list.**

**Abstract number:** A number with no associated units.

**Algorithm:** Any mathematical procedure or instructions involving a set of steps to solve a problem.

**Arithmetic mean:** M = (x1 + x2 + .... xn) / n (n = sample size).

**Arithmetic sequence:** A sequence of numbers in which each term (subsequent to the first) is generated by adding a fixed constant to its predecessor.

**Axiom:** Any assumption on which a mathematical theory is based.

**Average:** The sum of several quantities divided by the number of quantities (also called mean).

**Binary operation:** An operation that is performed on just two elements of a set at a time.

**Cartesian coordinates:** Cartesian coordinates (x,y) specify the position of a point in a plane relative to the horizontal x and the vertical y axes. The x and y axes form the basis of two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

**Coefficient:** A number or letter before a variable in an algebraic expression that is used as a multiplier.

**Common denominator:** A denominator that is common to all the fractions within an equation. The smallest number that is a common multiple of the denominators of two or more fractions is the lowest (or least) common denominator (LCM).

**Common factor:** A whole number that divides exactly into two or more given numbers. The largest common factor for two or more numbers is their highest common factor (HCF).

**Common logarithm:** Logarithm with a base of 10 shown as log10 [log1010x = x].

**Complex numbers:** A combination of real and imaginary numbers of the form a + bi where a and b are real numbers and i is the square root of -1 (see imaginary number). While real numbers can be represented as points on a line, complex numbers can only be located on a plane. See Types of Numbers.

**Composite number:** Any integer which is not a prime number, i.e., evenly divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.

**Congruent:** Alike in all relevant respects.

**Constant:** A quality of a measurement that never changes in magnitude.

**Coordinate:** A set of numbers that locates the position of a point usually represented by (x,y) values.

**Cosine law:** For any triangle, the side lengths a, b, c and corresponding opposite angles A, B, C are related as follows: a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cosA etc. The law of cosines is useful to determine the unknown data of a triangle if two sides and an angle are known. See Wikipedia: Cosine Law.

**Cube root:** The factor of a number that, when it is cubed (i.e., x3) gives that number.

**Decimal:** A fraction having a power of ten as denominator, such as 0.34 = 34/100 or 0.344 = 344/1000. In the continent, a comma is used as the decimal point (between the unit figure and the numerator).

**Even number:** A natural number that is divisible by two.

**Exponent (power, index):** A number denoted by a small numeral placed above and to the right of a numerical quantity, which indicates the number of times that quantity is multiplied by itself. In the case of X^n, it is said that X is raised to the power of n. When a and b are non-zero real numbers and p and q are integers, the following rules of power apply:

ap x aq = ap+q;  (ap)q = apq;  (a1/n)m = am/n;  a1/2 x b1/2 = (ab)1/2.

**Factorial:** The product of a series of consecutive positive integers from 1 to a given number (n). It is expressed with the symbol ( ! ). For example, 5! = 5x4x3x2x1 = 120. As a rule (n!+n) is evenly divisible by n.

**Factor:** When two or more natural numbers are multiplied, each of the numbers is a factor of the product. A factor is then a number by which another number is exactly divided (a divisor).

The gradient of two points on a line is calculated as rise (vertical increase) divided by run (horizontal increase), therefore, the gradient of a line is equal to the tangent of the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (y/x). See Mathlets: Lines and Slopes; Curve Bank: Slope.

**Logarithm:** The logarithm of a number N to a given base b is the power to which the base must be raised to produce the number N. Written as logb N. Naturally, logb bx = x. In any base, the following rules apply: log (ab) = log a + log b; log (a/b) = log a - log b; log (1/a) = -log a; log ab = b log a; log 1 = 0 and log 0 is undefined. See Logarithmic Transformations.

**Prime number:** A natural number other than 1, evenly divisible only by 1 and itself. The numbers 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,... Apart from 2, all primes are odd numbers and odd primes fall into two groups: those that are one less than a multiple of four (3,7,11,19) and those one more than a multiple of four (5,13,17). Every natural number greater than 1 may be resolved into a product of prime numbers; eg 8316 = 22 x 33 x 7 x 11.

**Proper divisor:** Any number divides another without leaving a remainder.

**Proper fraction:** A fraction in which the numerator is smaller than the denominator; i.e., a fraction smaller than 1.

**Rational number:** A number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, e.g. 6/7. The set of rational numbers is denotes as â€˜Qâ€™ for quotient. See Types of Numbers.

**Real number:** Rational (fractions) and irrational (numbers with non-recurring decimal representation) numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted as â€˜Râ€™ for real. In computing, any number with a fractional (or decimal) part. Basically, real numbers are all numbers except imaginary numbers (such as the square root of -1). See Types of Numbers.

**Root:** If, when a number is raised to the power of n gives the answer a, then this number is the nth root of a (a1/n).

**Rounding:** To give a close approximation of a number by dropping the least significant numbers. For example 15.88 can be rounded up to 15.9 (or 16) and 15.12 can be rounded down to 15.1 (or 15).

**Scientific notation (exponential notation, standard form):** One way of writing very small or very large numbers. In this notation, numbers are shown as (0<N<10) x 10q. An equivalent form is N.Eq. For example; 365,000 is 3.65x105 or 3.65E5. See Wikipedia: Scientific Notation.

**Unit:** A standard measurement.

**Variable:** An amount whose value can change.

**Vector:** A quantity characterised by a magnitude and a direction represented by (1) column form: two numbers (components) in a 2x1 matrix; (2) geometric form: by arrows in the (x,y)-plane; or (3) component form: the Cartesian unit vectors i (x-axis unit vector) and j (y-axis unit vector). The magnitude of a vector | u | is the length of the corresponding arrow and the direction is the angle (Î¸) the vector makes with the positive x-axis. When a1 and aÂ­2Â­ are the components of the vector a (magnitude | a | = (a12 + a22)1/2), it equals to a = a1i + a2j in component form, which equals to a = | a | cos(Î¸)i + | a | sin(Î¸)j. The angle (Î¸) can be found as arctan (a2 / a1). Cosine rule and sine rule are used for conversion of vectors from one form to another.

**Vertex:** The point where lines intersect.
