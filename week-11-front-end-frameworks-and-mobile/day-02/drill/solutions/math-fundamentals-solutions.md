## Challenges

**1. What is log<sub>4</sub>(256)?**

**Answer:** `4`

**2. What is log<sub>5</sub>(0.0016)?**

  0.0016 = 16/10,000 = 1/625 = 1/54 = 5-4

**Answer:** log<sub>5</sub>(0.0016) = `-4`

**3. What is log<sub>3</sub>(729)?**

   729 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 36

**Answer:** log<sub>3</sub>(729) = 6

**4. What is log<sub>2</sub>(0.015625)?**

**Answer:** log<sub>2</sub>(0.015625) = -6

**5. Write 1,024 = 2<sup>10</sup> in logarithmic form**

   In 1,024 = 2<sup>10</sup>, the base number is 2 and the exponent is 10.

## Stretch Challenges

**1.Rewrite equation as (1/2)2x + 1 = (1/2)0**
```
   Leads to 2x + 1 = 0

   Solve for x: x = -1/2
```
**2. Divide all terms by x y and rewrite equation as: ym -    1 = x2**
```
   Take ln of both sides (m - 1) ln y = 2 ln x

   Solve for m: m = 1 + 2 ln(x) / ln(y)
```
**3. Use log rule of product: log4(10) = log4(2) + log4(5)**
```
   log4(2) = log4(41/2) = 1/2

   Use change of base formula to write: log4(5) = log8(5) / log8(4) = b / (2/3) , since log8(4) = 2/3
   log4(10) = log4(2) + log4(5) = (1 + 3b) / 2
```
