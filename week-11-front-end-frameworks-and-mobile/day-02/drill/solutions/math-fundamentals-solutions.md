Solutions to the Above Problems

1. **Rewrite equation as (1/2)2x + 1 = (1/2)0**
```
   Leads to 2x + 1 = 0

   Solve for x: x = -1/2
```
2. **Divide all terms by x y and rewrite equation as: ym -    1 = x2**
```
   Take ln of both sides (m - 1) ln y = 2 ln x

   Solve for m: m = 1 + 2 ln(x) / ln(y)
```
3. **Use log rule of product: log4(10) = log4(2) + log4(5)**
```
   log4(2) = log4(41/2) = 1/2

   Use change of base formula to write: log4(5) = log8(5) / log8(4) = b / (2/3) , since log8(4) = 2/3
   log4(10) = log4(2) + log4(5) = (1 + 3b) / 2
```

8. **Use change of base formula using ln to rewrite the    given equation as follows:**
```
    ln (x) / ln(3) = A ln(x) / ln(5)
    A = ln(5) / ln(3)
```
