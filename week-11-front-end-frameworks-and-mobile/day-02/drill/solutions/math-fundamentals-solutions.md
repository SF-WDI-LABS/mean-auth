Solutions to the Above Problems

1. Rewrite equation as (1/2)2x + 1 = (1/2)0
   Leads to 2x + 1 = 0
   Solve for x: x = -1/2

2. Divide all terms by x y and rewrite equation as: ym -    1 = x2
   Take ln of both sides (m - 1) ln y = 2 ln x
   Solve for m: m = 1 + 2 ln(x) / ln(y)

3. Use log rule of product: log4(10) = log4(2) + log4(5)
   log4(2) = log4(41/2) = 1/2
   Use change of base formula to write: log4(5) = log8(5) / log8(4) = b / (2/3) , since log8(4) = 2/3
   log4(10) = log4(2) + log4(5) = (1 + 3b) / 2

4. log6(216) + [ log(42) - log(6) ] / log(49)
= log6(63) + log(42/6) / log(72)
= 3 + log(7) /2 log(7) = 3 + 1/2 = 7/2


5. ((3-1 - 9-1) / 6)1/3 = ((1/3 - 1/9) / 6)1/3
= ((6 / 27) / 6)1/3 = 1/3


6. Use change of base formula: (logxa)(logab)
= logxa (logxb / logxa) = logxb


7. 2 = logae
   a2 = e
   ln(a2) = ln e
   2 ln a = 1
   a = e1/2

8. Use change of base formula using ln to rewrite the    given equation as follows

    ln (x) / ln(3) = A ln(x) / ln(5)
    A = ln(5) / ln(3)

9. Rewrite given equation as: log [ log (2 + log2(x + 1)) ] = log (1) , since log(1) = 0.

   log (2 + log2(x + 1)) = 1
   2 + log2(x + 1) = 10
   log2(x + 1) = 8
   x + 1 = 28
   x = 28 - 1

10. Note that b4 logbx = x4
The given equation may be written as: 2x x4 = 486
x = 2431/5 = 3
