## What is Swift?

Swift is a multi-paradigm, compiled programming language created for iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS development by Apple Inc. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. Swift is intended to be more resilient to erroneous code ("safer") than Objective-C and also more concise.  --Wikipedia

## Syntax

For the duration of this demo we will be working in an environment know as a "playground".  You can think of this environment like a repl for Swift.  This is the area where you can experiment with the code and get to know the language a little more.
