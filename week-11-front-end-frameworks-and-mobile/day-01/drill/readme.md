Interview Tips & Best Practices


When in an interview it is important to follow these best practices in order to increase your chances of getting the job you want.

Communicate clearly and effectively

If you get stuck that's okay.  You can still work it out.

If you say that you know a language or framework, make sure you know that language or technology.

Don't hijack the interview from the interviewer.

Ask what the interview format is going to be and practice that format leading up to the interview.

Be sure to thank the interviewer and follow up with them about the time spent on the interview.

Understand the different types of interviews that can be done and work through some.

Some interviews are phone based.  Others are a take home coding challenge.  Still others are purely white boarding in from of the CTO's, and finally others are a coding challenge done with another developer.
