| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Create at least one GitHub issue on your Project 1 repo |
| Fork and clone your partner's project |
| Pair program to resolve the issue, and submit a pull request |

**Please keep track of time - you should spend roughly 1.5 hours on each project.**

## Step 1: Create an Issue on Your Project

* With your partner, discuss what your application does at a high level. This is a good opportunity to practice your project's "elevator pitch".
* Discuss one minor issue your project has. Make sure it's a relatively small addition that could be solved with the tools we already have (Express, jQuery, etc.).
* Create a new GitHub issue on your project's repo. Be descriptive of what's wrong and how you'd like it fixed. You could even give some rough steps you'd take to solve it.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Partner's Project

* **Fork** your partner's project.
* **Clone** the fork into your `develop` folder on your local machine.
* Make a new **branch** named after the issue you're solving.

  ```zsh
  ➜  git checkout -b fix-login-redirect
  ```

* See if you can successfully set up your partner's project by following the instructions in their `readme`. Note any roadblocks you hit along the way (and create GitHub issues for those roadblocks).

## Step 3: Pair Program to Fix the Issue

* Make sure you're working on your **fork** of your partner's project, on the new **branch** named after the issue you're solving.
* Pair program to solve the issue. Make frequent commits.

## Step 4: Resolve the Issue

* Push your **branch** to your remote fork of your partner's project.

  ```zsh
  ➜  git push origin fix-login-redirect
  ```

* Navigate to your remote fork on github.com, and submit the branch `fix-login-redirect` as a pull request.
* Your partner should code review and merge the pull request. They can code review small changes on github.com, or they can fetch the pull request's branch and test it locally.

## Step 5: Repeat

Make sure you each get a chance to create and resolve a GitHub issue. Split your time equally between each project.
