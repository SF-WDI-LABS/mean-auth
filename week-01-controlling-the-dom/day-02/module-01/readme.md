## Another Perspective

Many sources compare well-structured HTML to a tree. We can also think of it as a top-down architecture, like a mobile.

If you were asked to build this mobile with HTML and CSS, what classes and ids would you use?

## Challenges

Fork and clone the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/css-basics-challenges" target="_blank">css-basics-challenges</a> repo, and work through the challenges below. *Note you will have to link the CSS file first.*

  * mouse
  * canary
  * penguin
  * salmon
  * cat

  * sheep
  * parakeet
  * tuna

2. Apply the following colors to the list using ids:
  * mouse "color: gray"
  * canary "color: orangered"
  * penguin "color: black"
  * salmon "color: salmon"
  * cat "color: sienna"
  * goldfish "color: gold"
  * dog "color: tan"

  * tuna "color: purple"

3. Add the following background colors to the list using classes:
  * mammal "lavenderblush"
  * bird "lightgray"
  * fish "lightyellow"

4. Make the mammals bold, the birds italic, and the fish underlined.

7. Give all list items a top border with a width of 3 pixels, a color of seagreen, and a style of solid.

## Stretch Challenge

Modern web developers rarely start from scratch anymore. Many of us use frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, Initializr and others. These frameworks take the architectural decision-making out of the process, allowing us to focus on more specific design, interface and development questions.

That said, there's still value in creating your own grid from scratch to solidify some of the most elusive concepts behind writing great HTML and CSS.

**Challenge:** Fork and clone the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/css-grid-challenges" target="_blank">css-grid-challenges</a> repo, then add CSS styles try to match this design:
