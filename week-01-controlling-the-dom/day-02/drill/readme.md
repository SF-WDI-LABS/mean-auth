# Dǝbugging Challenges

| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Gain experience following a program as it runs. |
| Understand common developer pitfalls. |
| Fix common problems which impact developers. |

## Why?

> If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Programming#Debugging)

We are human and make mistakes. It's OK to make mistakes but in a complex computer program they are hard to track down. Becoming comfortable with debugging will make it easier to track down errors in logic.

The real world impact of bugs can be both funny and deadly. [List of software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs) **incomplete**

### Challenges

Challenges are primarily available as independent JSFiddle code snippets. The code in JSFiddle can be executed as if it were running on your website.

To execute a challenge on JSFiddle, click the "Run" button.

For advanced challenges we'll use [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/) which we recommend using for practice. A CodeWars account is required for an advanced challenge.
