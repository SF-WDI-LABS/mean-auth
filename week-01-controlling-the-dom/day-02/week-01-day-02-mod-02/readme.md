### Why you might want to use Bootstrap
 1. <b>Speed of Development</b><br>
  The use of Bootstrap really increases the speed at which a developer can stylize their webpage.  There are a lot of prewritten tools that allow the developer to put together a page without coding from scratch.

 2. <b>Responsiveness</b><br>
  Bootstrap comes with a responsive design pattern that allows programmers to create pages that respond to the different screen sizes of phones, tablets, and computer monitors.

 3. <b>Customization</b><br>
  While Bootstrap comes with a lot of built in features, a developer can customize the different components of Bootstrap to create a look that fits the needs of the site.

 4. <b>Support</b><br>
  There is a large community of developers that use Bootstrap in their personal projects and on the professional landscape.  Because of this, there is a large and well-documented community of support throughout the web whenever a developer has a question or runs into a problem.

### How to use Bootstrap
<li>Add the viewport meta tag and the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download">Bootstrap CDN</a> to the ```<head></head>``` of your HTML file.

``` <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
```
