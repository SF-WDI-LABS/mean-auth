| Explain the difference between primitive and reference data types |
| Use the JS console to manipulate data and create objects |

## Primitives

A primitive value is represented at the lowest level of implementation of a programming language. All primitives are immutable, meaning they can't be changed.

JavaScript has **6 primitive data types**:

  * **String:** words in quotes
  * **Number:** integer or float (decimal)
  * **Boolean:** `true` or `false`
  * **null:** non-existant object
  * **undefined:** empty variable
  * **Symbol:** identifier for object properties (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol" target="_blank">only in ES6</a>)

### Expressions

Data types like `Number` or `String` are not very useful without being able to form expressions, or combinations of values.

```js
1 + 1
//=> 2

2 - 1
//=> 1
```

You can also create expressions with strings using addition. This is called **string concatination**.

```js
"Hello, " + "world!"
//=> "Hello, world!"

"WDI " + 24
//=> "WDI 24"
```

### Number Operators

In order to perform certain number operations, JavaScript has a `Math` object with some very useful methods.

```js
// 3^2
Math.pow(3, 2)
//=> 4

// 2^4
Math.pow(2, 4)
//=> 16

// âˆš4
Math.sqrt(4)
//=> 2

// returns a random decimal number between 0 and 1
Math.random()
//=> .229375290430

// returns a random decimal number between 0 and 10
Math.random() * 10
//=> 1.9611513358540833

// removes decimal places
Math.floor(3.9999)
//=> 3
```

## Objects

Primitive data types are not enough for most programming purposes. We need collections of data that we can use efficiently. Objects are **reference data types** that allow us to group primitives together.

```js
// array
var cars = ["Black Tesla", "Red Toyota"];

// object literal
var car = { make: "Tesla", model: "S", color: "red", year: 2015 };
```

### Arrays

Arrays are collections of data stored in sequential order.  Arrays are great for:

* Storing data
* Enumerating data, i.e. using an index to find items
* Quickly reordering data

```js
var friends = ["Moe", "Larry", "Curly"];
//=> ["Moe", "Larry", "Curly"]
```

Items in an array are indexed starting at 0 and ending at length - 1.

```js
var firstFriend = friends[0];
//=> "Moe"

var lastFriend = friends[2];
//=> "Curly"
```

JavaScript gives us some useful built-in methods:

```js
friends.length();
//=> 3

friends.indexOf("Larry");
//=> 2

friends.push("Jane");
//=> ["Moe", "Larry", "Curly", "Jane"]
```

### Object Literals

Object literals store data as key and value pairs. They're like arrays except that data isn't stored in any sorted order and keys don't have to numbered indexes.

```js
// create object literal
var pet = { name: "Spot", species: "Dog", age: 4 };

// access value stored with the key "name"
pet["name"]
//=> "Spot"
pet['name']
//=> "Spot"
pet.name
//=> "Spot"
```

## Challenges

1. Store your first name in a variable.
2. Concatenate your first name with your last name, and store the result in another variable.
3. Use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split" target="_blank">`split`</a> method to turn your string variable from challenge #2 into an array.
4. Use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof" target="_blank">`typeof`</a> method to show how the output of the `split` operation from challenge #3 is different from the input.

1. Find the fourth name in the following array:

  ```js
  var friends = [
    "Moe",
    "Larry",
    "Curly",
    "Jane",
    "Emma",
    "Elizabeth",
    "Greg",
    "Lydia"
  ];
  ```

2. Change the name "Elizabeth" to "Liz" in the friends array.

3. Add your name to the end of the `friends` array, and add another name to beginning. (push, shift)

4. Sort the `friends` array in alphabetical order. (sort)

5. Now we have two lists of friends below. Combine them into one list and sort them. (concat)

  ```js
  var myFriends = [
    "Rickon",
    "Meera",
    "Hodor",
    "Jojen",
    "Osha",
    "Rickard",
    "Maester"
  ];

  var yourFriends = [
    "Bilbo",
    "Boromir",
    "Elrond",
    "Faramir",
    "Frodo",
    "Gandalf",
    "Legolas",
    "Pippin"
  ];
  ```

6. I have a list of favorite foods below. If "Popcorn" is my favorite food and "Potato chips" my second favorite, how would you find the rank of another food. Try "Pho". (indexOf)

  ```js
  var foods = [
    "Popcorn",
    "Potato chips",
    "Shrimp",
    "Tacos",
    "French toast",
    "Crab",
    "Pho",
    "Lasagna",
    "Brownie",
    "Lobster",
    "Donuts",
    "Ice cream",
    "Hamburger",
    "Sushi",
    "Chocolate",
    "Pizza"
  ];
  ```

7. I made a mistake with my favorite foods. How can I find the index of "Donuts" and remove it? (splice)

8. My friends want to know what my 5th to 10th favorite foods are. (slice)

1. How would you represent the following data using an object literal? Then update John's address to "1234 Park Ln".

  ```
  John, Doe, 36, 1234 Park St.
  ```
