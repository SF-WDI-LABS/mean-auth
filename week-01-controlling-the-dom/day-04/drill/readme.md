## Problem 1: Swapping Variables

Write a program that will swap the values of two variables. That is, if we start with:
```
x == "a"; // => true
y == "b"; // => true
```
Once the program has finished running we will have:
```
x == "b"; // => true
y == "a"; // => true
```
__Note: Think about why we cant just do something like x = y followed by y = x. What goes wrong when we try to do this?__

## Problem 2: Reverse a String

Write a function called reverse that takes in a string and returns the reverse of the string. For example:
```
reverse("Hello"); // => returns "olleH"
```
Note: You cannot use any built-in array or string methods!

## Problem 3: Vowel Count

Write a `vowels` function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
