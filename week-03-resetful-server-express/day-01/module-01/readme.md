## What is CRUD?

* **C:** Create
* **R:** READ
* **U:** Update
* **D:** Delete

## The REST of CRUD

* REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
* By the type of request you are making (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE) you are representing what you want to do server side (Create, Read, Update, Destroy).

## AJAX Refresher: GET & POST

## Challenges

*Use starter code for this; make solution branch*

* Practice CREATE and READ with Postman
* Set up new front-end project
* AJAX to GET all books
* Display all books on page with Handlebars templating
* Form to CREATE a new book
* AJAX to POST `/books`
* Add newly created book to page with Handlebars templating
