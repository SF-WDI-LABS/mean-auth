You've been hired to create a way for the IRS to find people to send rebates to. We have a list of identifiers (fake social security numbers) which will receive a rebate if our software can find them quickly enough to send them rebates. If we take too long to send rebates then everyone will hate the IRS.

Whenever we send a rebate we must check if the person is a thief before we send the rebate otherwise we'll go broke before we send out all the rebates.

## Challenge

Implement the `sendRebate` function which accepts three parameters `allPeople`, `thieves` and `peopleWithRebates`.

Starter code is provided <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/irs-rebate" target="_blank">here</a> and is executed using `node sendRebate.js`.

1. Try to come up with a solution to the problem, an example solution is provided but doesn't work well enough to be used. <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/irs-rebate/compare/example-solution" target="_blank">Example Solution</a>.

If you can't complete this challenge, it is OK. We'll get together at the end of class and talk over the solution.
