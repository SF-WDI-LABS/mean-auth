## Problem # 1 - Palindrome

Write a program that determines if a string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards as backwards, like "racecar".

For additional complexity, discount white space and punctuation, so that a string like "never odd or even" would be accepted as well.

```js
isPalindrome('racecar');
// => true
isPalindrome('apple');
// => false
```

## Problem # 2 - Greatest Difference

Given an array of numbers, write a program that returns the greatest difference from subtracting any two elements.

```js
greatestDiff([-18, 72, 5, 43, -34, 106]);
// => 140
```

## Problem # 3 - List Combination

Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

## Problem # 4 - Fibonacci

Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.
