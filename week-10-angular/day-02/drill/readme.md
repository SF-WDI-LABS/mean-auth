Today we'll practice technical vocabulary. We'll start by trying to match the definition to the term for a reduced set of the following terms. After that we'll explore additional terms and people will breakup into groups of two in order to practice the terms we've found.

**NOTE:** You're not expected to memorize all this and I found myself looking up many terms while making this list. However, these terms are useful to understand and will help in future growth.

## Core Concepts

Many of these terms will be completely foreign to software developers. Looking up each term will add to your growing depth of knowledge.

## Servers

Each server does something for you and might be helpful. It is rare to find someone who's an expert with many different servers.

Don't judge yourself if you only know one or two servers. That is normal.

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |

| PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Elasticsearch | Redis | MemcacheDB | NGinx | Apache HTTPd | Unicorn |
| CouchDB | MySQL | MSSQL | Oracle (Many Types) | IIS | Varnish | Squid | Sendmail |
| QMail | SSHd | FTPd | NFS | ClusterFS | NPTd | Remote Desktop | Solr |
| GUnicorn | WSGI | Tomcat | LightHTTPd | Dancer | Jabber | Git | Subversion |
| Mercurial | Rexter | Neo4j | OrientDB | MonetDB | Greenplum | OpenTSDB | InfluxDB |
| Rails Server | Django Server | Node Servers | Rack | Express Server | Gunicorn | Passenger | Twisted |
