| Objectives |
|------------|
| Students will be able to create and write to a file. |
| Students will be able to read from a file. |
| Students will be able to close files. |
| Students will be able to see if a file exists and what properties it may have. |

## Why?

In most real-world applications, you'll be working with datasets that are too large to include in a program in a predefined string or collection.

You will also find that most interviews test your knowledge on how to access and manipulate files as part of the technical questions
(This is something similar to the interview question that was posed to me by Erik.)

## Check for a file and it's properties

## Read from a File

## Create and Write a file

## Close a File
